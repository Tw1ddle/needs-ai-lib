Needs AI is a utility-based AI library written in Haxe. Run the web demo [here](http://tw1ddle.github.io/needs-ai/index.html), or read the documentation [here](http://tw1ddle.github.io/needs-ai-lib/index.html).

Utility-based AI is useful in games where agents have to satisfy several competing needs - like in The Sims.

An agent is modelled as a set of needs, a set of actions, and a strategy that executes actions to meet the needs. Agents continually evaluate the relative urgency of their needs.
